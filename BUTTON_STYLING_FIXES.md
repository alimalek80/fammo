# Button Styling Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Invisible Navigation Buttons** - Previous/Next buttons were white and not visible
2. **Poor Contrast** - Button text was hard to read
3. **Inconsistent Styling** - Buttons didn't match the theme

## Changes Made:

### 1. Enhanced Button Styling (`wizard_step.html`)
- **Previous Button**: Now gray with white text and proper contrast
- **Next Button**: Blue gradient with white text and shadow effects
- **Submit Button**: Green gradient with check icon
- **Added Hover Effects**: Subtle scaling and shadow changes
- **Forced Colors**: Used `!important` to override theme conflicts

### 2. Improved Input Field Styling (`forms.py`)
- **Pet Name Input**: Larger, more visible with proper borders
- **Enhanced Focus States**: Blue ring when focused
- **Better Contrast**: White background with dark text
- **Proper Sizing**: Larger padding for better usability

### 3. Added Strong CSS Rules (`wizard_step.html`)
- **Button Visibility**: Ensured buttons always have proper colors
- **Shadow Effects**: Added depth with box-shadows
- **Hover States**: Improved interactive feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Buttons work well on all screen sizes

## Visual Improvements:
- ✅ **Previous Button**: Gray background, white text, clearly visible
- ✅ **Next Button**: Blue-purple gradient, white text, attractive
- ✅ **Submit Button**: Green gradient, white text with check icon
- ✅ **Input Fields**: White background, dark text, blue focus ring
- ✅ **Hover Effects**: Buttons lift slightly and gain stronger shadows

## Browser Compatibility:
- Uses both CSS classes and inline styles for maximum compatibility
- Fallback colors ensure visibility across all themes
- Strong specificity with `!important` overrides theme conflicts

The wizard buttons are now clearly visible and provide excellent user experience!
